            <h2>Main Types of Stars</h2>
            <p>Stars are characterized by their properties, such as color and temperature. Here are a few examples of the different types of stars.</p>

                <li>O-Type Stars - The hottest and bluest of all stars.</li>
                <li>White Dwarf - The aftermath of the death of a star the size of our sun or smaller.</li>
                <li>Neutron Stars - Very small and dense cores of exploded stars.</li>
                <li>Supergiants - Massive stars that are highly developed.</li>
                <li>Red Dwarf - Red and relatively cool.</li>
